when going down to serve Floor 1 buttons the elevator goes to the floor, but cant open door and stop elevator as it should, same on the top. I can observe that this only happens when there ar no other orders than either floor 4 down or floor 1 up.

when on its way down the elevator stops at at floors that wants to go up.

looks like the down state is wrong, 

when elevator goes up it acts as it should.

when going down it stops at floors wanting to go up.

also when going down to floors wanting to go down the elevator makes noice and goes between IDLE and DOWN.
